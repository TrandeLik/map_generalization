## Algorithm logic
This directory contains files that implement all algorithm logic. Here you can find following code: 
- Polyline class 
- Geometric computations
- Generation of random polylines
- Algorithm stages:
  - Bringing a polyline to an equidistant form
  - Creating a segmentation of polyline
  - Computing Minkowski dimension
  - Douglas Peucker algorithm
  - Smoothing with B-splines
